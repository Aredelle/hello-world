# hello-world
um yada yada yada yada yada

So I'm supposed to write about myself. I'm not one to talk that much. It's tiring...explaining stuff that is. Putting my words into thoughts. Instead, i just like to bottle them up all inside and not think about them. Numb out all the pain with a nice, sunshiny korean drama. I don't like to feel.
